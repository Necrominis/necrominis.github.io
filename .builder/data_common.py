TT_3D_PRINTING = """3D printing is the construction of physical objects from a digital 3D model file, using a machine called a 3D printer."""

TT_DRY_BLENDING = """Dry-blending is the technique of using the dry-brushing technique to achieve results similar to wet-blending, in order to create smooth blends between colors on a miniature."""

TT_DRY_BRUSHING = """Dry-brushing is the technique of wiping most of the paint off your brush and lightly brushing a miniature, in order to only catch the raised edges with a light dusting of a highlight color."""

TT_EDGE_HIGHLIGHTING = """Edge highlighting is the technique where you paint the raised edges and corners on a miniature brighter than noraml, in order to help them stand out more, and because edges tend to reflect slightly more light in real life."""

TT_GLAZING = """Glazing is the technique of using very diluted paint in order to tint a miniature with a certain color. Glazing can be applied in layers to create smooth transitions between bolors."""

TT_LAYERING = """Layering is the technique of creating a smooth blend between colors by using multiple layers slightly thinned paint and shrinking each layer to create a smooth transition between colors."""

TT_NMM = """Non-metallic metal, or NMM, is the technique of painting a miniature to look shiny or metallic using solid color paints and high contrast, rather than using actual glossy or metallic paints."""

TT_SPRUE_GOO = """Sprue-goo is a sumstance made from melting bits of plastic sprues into plastic cement. Due to its thickness, it can be used in place of plastic cement to fill in gaps when gluing pieces together."""

TT_STIPPLING = """Stippling is a painting technique where you gently jab with the tip of your paint brush to create spotty splotches of color. It’s usually used for texturing rough-looking surfaces, or combined with glazing to create smooth blends."""

TT_TABLE_READY = """Table-ready is a term to describe a miniature thay may not look as good as the painter would like, but looks good enough that it’s ready to be played with on in tabletop games."""

TT_VOLUMETRIC_HIGHLIGHTING = """Volumetric highlighting is the technique of highlighting and shading a miniature based on the physical properties of how light behaves on shapes and textures, rather than simply highlighting raised edges and shading recesses, in order to create a more realistic miniature."""

TT_WASH = """Washes are paints diluted with water, which can be "washed" onto a miniature in order for the paint to flow into the recesses, usually for shading purposes."""

TT_WET_BLENDING = """wet-blending is the technique of painting an area of a miniature with two colors and smudging the border between them while the paint is still wet, in order to create smooth blends between colors on a miniature."""

TT_ZENITHAL_HIGHLIGHTING = """Zenithal highlighting the technique of base coating a miniature black, then spraying white paint from above, in order to give an aproximation of sunlight creating shadows and highlights."""
