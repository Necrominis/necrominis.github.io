			f"""The first thing I worked on for this miniature was actually the base. I primed it black and gave it a rough airbrushing of a dark purple. I then wanted to create a glowing effect coming out of the cracks between the stone, so I dry-brushed dark teal around the cracks, then a lighter teal closer to the cracks, and then filled in the cracks with a lime green.""",
			
			f"""For the actual vampire model, I started with the skin first. I layered from a medium grey to a light grey, but with some purple mixed in, with more purple in the darker tones, and more grey in the lighter tones. I used a similar technique for the wing arms, except using dark teal instead of purple. As for the actual wings, I left them black, dry-brushed dark teal toward the ends, and added a spotty texture to them.""",
			
			f"""Seeing the rest of the model still black made me realize a dark outfit would fit the best and contrast with the light skin. The armor pieces remained black, but were highlighted toward dark purple and edge highlighted with a similar purple-grey mix from the skin’s base coat. The rest of the straps, the mace, and the hair were highlighted similarly with dark to medium greys, as I wanted to avoid using metallic paints for this mini.""",
			
			f"""The last details were a few gems and a bottle on the vampire’s waist. These were painted with the two teal colors and the lime green, to remain coherent with the base.""",
			
			f"""Finally, I airbrushed the two teal colors onto the model from below, to give the effect that the green light from the base is lighting up the vampire from below. Then I gave it a clear coat of gloss, for protective purposes, and matte for the final finish.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, I think this might be my best miniature yet, in terms of the color coherency, the skin shading, and the glow effect. One of my [previous miniatures](2022-03-15) had a better paint job for the skin, but that was with an airbrush; this miniature’s skin was painted by hand, and this one has higher contrast. I do think the wings’ spots could be redone, though. I wanted to highlight the horizontal folds in the wings, but they weren’t defined enough to catch the edge of my brush, and were too small to highlight by hand. Overall, though, I think this miniature turned out beautifully.""",

			f"""First I scratched the base with some [metal clay sculpting tools](army-painter-sculpting-tools) to create a tile or brick pattern on the base, as well as add a few scratches and dents.""",
			
			f"""Then I used [my airbrush](badger-105-patriot-air-brush) to paint the base according to the bright purple colors I wanted for the marble veins. I primed the base black, base coated with *Heavy Violet*, randomly sprayed *Royal Purple* (covering about 2/3 of the base), then randomly sprayed *Purple* (covering about 1/3 of the base).""",
			
			f"""Next I stretched out a cotton baby wipe (creating various stretches and small holes), let it dry out next to a fan, then wrapped it over the base. This would create the marble vein pattern by covering up the purple where the veins should be, so I could then paint the marble’s stone color.""",
			
			f"""I then sprayed the whole base black, and then sprayed it with *Hexed Lichen*, covering almost like a base coat, but with a slightly lighter touch in some areas so it wouldn’t appear too flat. Then I removed the baby wipe.""",
			
			f"""Finally, I touched up some of the veins with thin lines of *Purple*, painted black in the cracks and tile lines, and did some edge highlighting with *Purple* on each tile. I then painted the base rim black and gave it a clear coat.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, I think the effect turned out perfectly. It looks like some dark purple marble you might see in a necromancer’s base of operations. This was my first attempt to test a marble effect that I might use for the armor plates on my upcoming purple [*Necron*]T({URL_NECRON}) army. I think I have the technique down, but it’s too dark for my purposes. I might brighten the black stone parts to be more purple, and get a brighter purple for the veins. It also could use a little more contrast on the veins and edge highlights. I also think it might be worth using a satin or gloss coat, since marble is generally polished and not matte.""",

			f"""This was my first time using an airbrush to paint a miniature. I used [my new airbrush](badger-105-patriot-air-brush) to paint the base skin tones on the ork and his pet squig. Although I used an airbrush to get initial shadows and highlights, I still touched up the skin with a brush. I then used a brush for everything else.""",
			
			f"""I used a lot of colors on this mini, compared to usual, but I really ranted to add some variety in the many articles of clothing, and equipment. It also took a bit to get the squig’s color right, as I didn’t quite have the right paint colors for what I wanted. I tried to make the squig orange, but I didn’t have any light oranges that weren’t desaturated and almost tan, so it took a few inks and washes to get it to turn out right.""",
			
			f"""For the base, I simply used some *Army Painter* [*Brown Battleground*](army-painter-brown-battleground) basing sand and [*Field Grass*](army-painter-field-grass) flocking. I then finished it off with a brown rim.""",

			f"""All-in-all, I think the ork’s skin turned out beautifully, and is my best work yet, for skin tones. The squig didn’t turn out horribly either, though I’m not entirely happy with the color I ended up with. For my first airbrushed mini, I think this was a resounding success, and I’m excited to use my airbrush on anything I can.""",

			f"""I painted this mini as a gift for my partner, so I decided to paint it orange, instead of a traditional forest color like green, as it’s my partner’s color. Being such a small mini, the details were very straining to paint. I individually painted each scale, and while it turned out nice, it was a bit straining to accomplish.""",
			
			f"""This was my first time painting a metal miniature, which was...interesting. After gluing the wings on, I broke them off three times through the painting process. Not sure I’m a fan of the brittleness of metal minis.""",
			
			f"""Since the mini was on a random rocky shape, I decided to clue the mini onto a 1-inch wood disc for a base. I then blended the terrain with some [*Milliput*]({"milliput-standard-yellow-grey"}) epoxy, and covered it in grass, using [*Army Painter* grass flocking]({"army-painter-field-grass"}) and a few [*Vallejo* grass tufts]({"vallejo-wild-tuft-green"}). I painted the base and even the grass with the same teal as the wings, to try and limit my color palette, as well as bring everything together.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, I think the miniature turned out great. For having such small details, I was able to cleanly paint most of them, including the tiny teeth and eyes. I don’t think I’d paint a small metal miniature again, though, as it was too small to pin the parts together, and super glue didn’t hold the best.""",

			f"""I painted this miniature partly because I liked the black and gold coloring of the [*Stormcast Eternals*]({URL_STORMCAST_ETERNALS}) army *Anvils of Heldenhammer*, but also as a black armor test for my future *Space Marine* army.""",
			
			f"""The majority of the armor is black, highlighted slightly toward light blue. This blue helped match it with the blue glow of the spear head and the shield. The glow effect on the spear head isn't as good as I would've liked, but I had to use a subpar technique for it. Being winter and having the heat on has really dried out the air in my house. Even with a humidifier I found the paint drying very fast, often before even touching my brush to the model. This meant that glazing the standard gradient-based glow effects wouldn't work (I tested it on a spare mini and it didn't work). Therefore the glow effect was a mix of dry-brushing and edge-highlighting.""",
			
			f"""The metal parts were simply metallic paints and some washes. I got to test my new white contrast paint on the white details on the shoulder pads. The leather parts were my favorite technique of two browns and a wash.""",

			f"""The base was actually really fun to make here. I tried to go for a ruined brick road or building that's in the process of being reclaimed by nature. I broke and scratched some [*Green Stuff World* ceramic bricks]({"green-stuff-world-model-bricks"}), and then applied some *Stirland Mud* for texture. Finally, I added some [*Vallejo* grass tufts]({"vallejo-wild-tuft-green"}).""",

			f"""All-in-all, the miniature was a little hard to paint, due to the very low humidity, but adding flow improver to my paints helped a little. I think the black armor turned out great, the glow effects were good but not amazing, and the gold and silver armor was simple, but could've been improved a little, provided the paint played nicely.""",
