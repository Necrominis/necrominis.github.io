			f"""The first thing I worked on for this miniature was actually the base. I primed it black and gave it a rough airbrushing of a dark purple. I then wanted to create a glowing effect coming out of the cracks between the stone, so I dry-brushed dark teal around the cracks, then a lighter teal closer to the cracks, and then filled in the cracks with a lime green.""",
			
			f"""For the actual vampire model, I started with the skin first. I layered from a medium grey to a light grey, but with some purple mixed in, with more purple in the darker tones, and more grey in the lighter tones. I used a similar technique for the wing arms, except using dark teal instead of purple. As for the actual wings, I left them black, dry-brushed dark teal toward the ends, and added a spotty texture to them.""",
			
			f"""Seeing the rest of the model still black made me realize a dark outfit would fit the best and contrast with the light skin. The armor pieces remained black, but were highlighted toward dark purple and edge highlighted with a similar purple-grey mix from the skin’s base coat. The rest of the straps, the mace, and the hair were highlighted similarly with dark to medium greys, as I wanted to avoid using metallic paints for this mini.""",
			
			f"""The last details were a few gems and a bottle on the vampire’s waist. These were painted with the two teal colors and the lime green, to remain coherent with the base.""",
			
			f"""Finally, I airbrushed the two teal colors onto the model from below, to give the effect that the green light from the base is lighting up the vampire from below. Then I gave it a clear coat of gloss, for protective purposes, and matte for the final finish.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, I think this might be my best miniature yet, in terms of the color coherency, the skin shading, and the glow effect. One of my [previous miniatures](2022-03-15) had a better paint job for the skin, but that was with an airbrush; this miniature’s skin was painted by hand, and this one has higher contrast. I do think the wings’ spots could be redone, though. I wanted to highlight the horizontal folds in the wings, but they weren’t defined enough to catch the edge of my brush, and were too small to highlight by hand. Overall, though, I think this miniature turned out beautifully.""",

			f"""Next I stretched out a cotton baby wipe (creating various stretches and small holes), let it dry out next to a fan, then wrapped it over the base.

This was my first attempt to test a marble effect that I might use for the armor plates on my upcoming purple [*Necron*]T({URL_NECRON}) army. I think I have the technique down, but it’s too dark for my purposes. I might brighten the black stone parts to be more purple, and get a brighter purple for the veins. It also could use a little more contrast on the veins and edge highlights. I also think it might be worth using a satin or gloss coat, since marble is generally polished and not matte.""",

Although I used an airbrush to get initial shadows and highlights, I still touched up the skin with a brush. I then used a brush for everything else.""",
			
			f"""I used a lot of colors on this mini, compared to usual, but I really ranted to add some variety in the many articles of clothing, and equipment. It also took a bit to get the squig’s color right, as I didn’t quite have the right paint colors for what I wanted. I tried to make the squig orange, but I didn’t have any light oranges that weren’t desaturated and almost tan, so it took a few inks and washes to get it to turn out right.""",

			f"""I painted this miniature partly because I liked the black and gold coloring of the [*Stormcast Eternals*]({URL_STORMCAST_ETERNALS}) army *Anvils of Heldenhammer*, but also as a black armor test for my future *Space Marine* army.""",
			
			f"""The majority of the armor is black, highlighted slightly toward light blue. This blue helped match it with the blue glow of the spear head and the shield. The glow effect on the spear head isn’t as good as I would’ve liked, but I had to use a subpar technique for it. Being winter and having the heat on has really dried out the air in my house. Even with a humidifier I found the paint drying very fast, often before even touching my brush to the model. This meant that glazing the standard gradient-based glow effects wouldn’t work (I tested it on a spare mini and it didn’t work). Therefore the glow effect was a mix of dry-brushing and edge-highlighting.""",
			
			f"""The metal parts were simply metallic paints and some washes. I got to test my new white contrast paint on the white details on the shoulder pads. The leather parts were my favorite technique of two browns and a wash.""",

			f"""The base was actually really fun to make here. I tried to go for a ruined brick road or building that’s in the process of being reclaimed by nature. I broke and scratched some [*Green Stuff World* ceramic bricks]({"green-stuff-world-model-bricks"}), and then applied some *Stirland Mud* for texture. Finally, I added some [*Vallejo* grass tufts]({"vallejo-wild-tuft-green"}).""",

			f"""All-in-all, the miniature was a little hard to paint, due to the very low humidity, but adding flow improver to my paints helped a little. I think the black armor turned out great, the glow effects were good but not amazing, and the gold and silver armor was simple, but could’ve been improved a little, provided the paint played nicely.""",

			f"""I spent a few days painting this miniature. I wanted to give it a real try, with proper shading, highlighting, contrast, and texturing. I started with the skin, and highlighted from a dark green to a lime green. I added a yellow ink over it, to brighten up the slightly desaturated greens I used. I also did the same with a red ink to change the color on the scars, knees, and elbows. I think I nailed the level of contrast here, however the highlighting isn’t what you’d call "[volumetric]T({TT_VOLUMETRIC_HIGHLIGHTING})", as it’s a skill I haven’t explored yet as a miniature painter.""",
			
			f"""For the leather clothing, I tried to give it a very warn texture. During each highlighting step, I stippled on my edge-highlights, and added scratches over the material. I think the leather is my favorite part of this paint-job. I also did a toned-down version of this paint job for the straps and the spear shaft. However, I used a lighter brown to set it apart from the leather. I did the same with the sewing on the leather as well, to help it stand out.""",
			
			f"""For the metal armor and the spear blade, I tried to give it a dirty and worn feel as well. I added scratches with some silver, and then washed with brown to give it a slightly rusty and dirty look. To fully sell the rusty effect, I also stippled a rusty color onto a few spots.""",

			f"""The last thing I painted on the miniature was the red shield. In the box art, it’s fairly bright red. I tried to keep the red look, but bring a little realism into it. I kept it red, but less bright than the box art, and then I scratched up the edges a lot with some silver. I’m not completely sure if the shields are metal, but I assumed they were. I don’t know if the metal is painted on or not, but that’s the look I went for. The silver scratches look like paint has been scratched off. To further sell the metal look, I painted the teeth, eyes, and rivets bronze and silver as well.""",
			
			f"""Finally, the base was my favorite mix of *Stirland Mud* texture paint, and grass tufts. I also added two rocks onto the base as well. This model came with the character stepping on the helmet of an enemy faction, so I painted that as well. I painted it to match the bronze metal on the rest of the mini, to give it some coherence, and I dirtied it up a bit to blend it into the base. I refrained from my usual black base rim, and made it brown to match the base and the rest of the mini. I’m really enjoying how it really ties the model together.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, I could’ve done a bit better on the skin highlighting, but the rest of the mini turned out better than I could’ve hoped for. For a good test of my skills, I think it made it clear where my strengths and weaknesses lie. Now I know what to practice next!""",

I then did some mixing between the colors and white to highlight the details with the [dry-brush]T({TT_DRY_BRUSHING}) technique. I used my new [makeup brushes](ecotools-detail-liner) for this, as they have dense but soft bristles. I then did a [wash]T({TT_WASH}) over the body and limbs, to add shading in the recesses.

For the head I did a wash and then dry-brushed to blend toward orange on the tips. This technique turned out better than I could’ve hoped. The blend from tan to orange turned out very smooth. I’ll have to look out for other times I can use this technique.""",
			
			f"""These minis came with terrain attached, so to blend that into the whole base smoothly, I used my favorite texture paint *Stirland Mud*. Instead of using the thin black bases that come with *WizKids* minis, I used some 1-inch wood discs I had lying around. I can’t remember where I go them, though. Painting the base was simply a mix of greys and browns, a wash, and then dry-brushing, to resemble a dirty, rocky cave.""",

			f"""All-in-all, these minis turned out closer to the box art than I could’ve hoped for. The smooth blend on the head, using my "dry-blending" technique, worked perfectly, and I can’t wait to use this technique again.""",

I tried to keep him metallic, going off of the box-art color scheme of *[Warhammer’s Necrons](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Necron-Triarch-Praetorians-2020)*, but it didn’t turn out quite right. The gun-metal color worked fine, but the silver (on the head, toes, and claws) looked weird. The bronze colored metal parts aren’t perfect, but they work. They’re simply the same paint-job as the metal, but covered in a few layers of *Guilliman Flesh* *Contrast* paint. The blood also turned out a bit brighter than I would’ve liked. And finally, the metallic blue on the *Space Marine* helmet looks poor, but I was so fed up with this mini I’d rather print a new one and try a different method than fix it.""",
			
			f"""All-in-all, this mini had great potential, but didn’t turn out to a level that I’d be happy with. I’ll have to print some more and try again, though, because it’s a great model!""",

			f"""This has to be the smallest mini I’ve painted, so far. It was even printed at 120% scale, just to make sure he wouldn’t break if I breath on him too hard. Despite this, his print had two small failures. His left hand is partially missing, but it’s so small I elected to just accept it. The winding knob on his back was missing the lower half, so I sculpted a fix with some [*Green Stuff* epoxy](green-stuff-world-green-stuff-tape)*. It’s not perfect, but it really did turn out pretty good, considering the small size and super thin limbs.""",
			
			f"""This robot was mostly metal, so it was a good challenge to make sure he still has some color variety. Luckily, I used a gun-metal, a silver, and a brass color, so there was some variety in his metal parts. It was also a good way to distinguish metal plates and rods from hinges and other small details. He also had various leather straps, and some scrolls on his back, so was able to use a few colors as well, even if they were just browns and tans.""",
			
			f"""His base was some *Green Stuff* sculpted to make a small hill on top of a [*LITKO* 1-inch base](litko-1-inch-circular-base), then covered in *Agrellan Earth* to add that cracked texture. I do believe this is the fist base where I painted the rim with a complimenting color, rather than just black, and I have to say I think I’m hooked! It really makes the base’s environment feel more real.""",
